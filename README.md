# Python-Mortality-Rate

## Overview
This project is designed to help users understand how personal factors (such as age, gender, and smoking status) affects their risk of mortality and insurance premium rates. By using publicly available mortality tables, the application visualizes there risks and estimates simplifies insurance premiums. Users can input their characteristics to see their positioning on interactive graphs and explore hypothetical scenarios such as the impact of quitting smoking or aging on their insurance rates

## Features
#### - Mortality Rate Vizualization:
Displays mortality rates based on public datasets, allowing users to visual8ize riks by age, gender, and smoking status
#### - Interactive Risk Analysis:
Users can input their own characteristics to see where they fall on the risk curve and compare different scenarios
#### - Premium Estimator:
Simulates insurance premium calculations based on mortality risk
#### - Scenario Simulation:
Allows users to experiment with factors like age changes or smoking status to view potential impacts on both premium and mortality rates

## Technology Used
- Python: Logic and data handling
- Matplotlib: Data Visualization
- Pandas: Data Organization
- Flask or PyQt: User Interface
